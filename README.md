# perfect-k8s

+ Perfecting kubernetes and using ansible to deploy it to production servers
+ In this repo, we focus on k8s for orchestrating docker images on production.
+ We will use Ansible as the deployment tool instead of helm or other tools.
+ Both Ansible and K8s use YAML as the main language.
